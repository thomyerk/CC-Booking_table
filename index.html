        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>It is not a coincidence that we have a drawing of a tomato as the background of our menu card. The remark of
            a culinary expert
            from 1839 is true, the Italian cuisine's major component is indeed tomato. "Not only have generations of
            Naepolitanians been made happy by the brilliant idea of adding tomatoes to noodles and pizza, but everyone
            else who appreciates and loves Italian cuisine." The word Pomo D'oro means 'golden apple', however, written
            in one word its meaning changes to ‘tomato'.
            Originality is a key factor and we put great emphasise on it, this is why our head chef, Rosario, prepares a
            lot of dishes from his own collection of recipes apart from the traditional Italian meals. The dishes
            prepared in the guest area are very famous, not only because they amaze the guests by their spectacular
            sight, but once someone tastes them, they will surely remember their wonderful taste for a long time.</p>
